# BalancedBST

This is a project that I completed for my Data Structures course in the summer of 2021.  
Included in this repository is my code for a balanced binary search tree class.  I used unit
testing to debug my code, which is found in BST_Test.py.  The final file, Fraction.py, is an 
implementation of the BST class that sorts fractions.
